# justcausewebsite
This is a prototype build for the JustCause website.

## Technologies
The decision to go with this stack was made with the assumptions of a limited user base (a few hundred to a thousand a month) who primarily read information. The creation and editing of content is to be done by the admin users only.
- Meteor
- Mongo
- React

## Acknowledgements
[Pup boilerplate](https://github.com/cleverbeagle/pup) by CleverBeagle. This helped me go beyond the basic understanding gained from the meteor "todo" tutorial and is an excellent way to jumpstart a project.
