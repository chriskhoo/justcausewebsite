### This is my Markdown page

I can type **any** Markdown I want into this file and it will ultimately be `parsed` as HTML by Pup's `utility.getPage` Method.

To learn more, you can [read about this Method here](http://cleverbeagle.com/pup/v1/the-basics/methods#utility-methods).


To do list:
- is there a safe way to parse the markdown data vs using the code in components > Page?
- Can't seem to index (and weight collection)
- Search currently limited to report title and description do we need to extend this to other fields? if so which?
- add UX/UI elements - highlight current page in nav bar, change colour for panels that open (e.g. advance search / panels), search button color on hover
- template aside to remove effects from mouse over

### Done
- Report - go to website or click to donate to open in new tab
``<a href="http://example.com/files/myfile.pdf" target="_blank">Download</a>``
