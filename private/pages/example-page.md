### This is my Markdown page

I can type **any** Markdown I want into this file and it will ultimately be `parsed` as HTML by Pup's `utility.getPage` Method.

To learn more, you can [read about this Method here](http://cleverbeagle.com/pup/v1/the-basics/methods#utility-methods).


To do list:
- custom methods for jquery validation for pull down options
- responsive database (i.e. embedded data gets updated with source data gets updated)
- more detailed validation when doing the initial checks on the server and the client side
- Write tests
