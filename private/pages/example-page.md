### This is my Markdown page

I can type **any** Markdown I want into this file and it will ultimately be `parsed` as HTML by Pup's `utility.getPage` Method.

To learn more, you can [read about this Method here](http://cleverbeagle.com/pup/v1/the-basics/methods#utility-methods).


To do list:
- custom methods for jquery validation for pull down options
- responsive database (i.e. embedded data gets updated with source data gets updated)
- more detailed validation when doing the initial checks on the server and the client side
- Write tests
- is there a safe way to parse the markdown data vs using the code in components > Page?
- work out mechanism for timestamps on things like badge awards
- Do we need bullet points if we have MD?
- do we need timestamp for impact output / outcome / quotes?
- Search currently limited to report title and description do we need to extend this to other fields? if so which?
- Can't seem to index (and weight collection)
- Convert the sign up to a create user. Remove the login from the nav bar.
- add UX/UI elements - highlight current page in nav bar, change colour for panels that open (e.g. advance search / panels), search button color on hover
- template aside to remove effects from mouse over
- make banner creation (for detail level and article type) immune to case


- update export report icons
- update terms of service & the disclaimer in the top of the report
- update home page
